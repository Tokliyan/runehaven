# RuneHaven

2D persistent open-world isometric survival RPG. Single HTML file
(`runehaven.html`) + Supabase + Netlify. Governed by `RUNEHAVEN_BIBLE.md` — full text now in this repo, read it
directly, do not assume or invent anything it doesn't state.

## Layout

```
runehaven.html              the game — currently v19 (v20 in progress)
runehaven-art-style/         SKILL.md — read this before ANY rendering change
debug/run2.js                quick login-screen smoke test
debug/run3.js                REQUIRED full-boot harness (real login, 5 frames)
debug/run4.js                wear-down/taming-gate simulation
debug/run5.js                exhaustive branch-coverage sweep (every class/
                              weapon/armor/species/mob-state combo, once each)
```

Run any harness with: `node debug/runN.js runehaven.html` (or just
`node debug/runN.js` from inside `debug/`, defaulting to `../runehaven.html`).

## The standard process (non-negotiable)

1. **Read `runehaven-art-style/SKILL.md` in full** before touching any
   rendering code, even a small tweak.
2. Apply changes as **surgical, targeted patches** — never a full rewrite of
   a working section. Before any find-and-replace, confirm the anchor string
   is unique in the file (`grep -c "anchor text" runehaven.html` must return
   exactly the number of intended edit sites). An over-broad replace has
   caused a real shipped bug before (v13).
3. **Never invent bible content.** Pets, mobs, biomes, lore, and events must
   come from the bible. If a build needs a value the bible doesn't specify
   (an HP number, a cooldown, a percentage), that's fine to design — but
   flag it as a tunable, and never add a pet/mob/location the bible doesn't
   list without explicitly marking it non-canon.
4. After patching, run in order and require ALL to pass before shipping:
   - `node -e` parse check (`new Function(scriptText)` must not throw)
   - a grep checklist confirming every intended change landed AND every
     prior feature is still present (preservation checks, not just new ones)
   - `node debug/run3.js runehaven.html` — must show `CAUGHT ERROR: none`
   - `node debug/run4.js runehaven.html` — all `PASS`, zero `FAIL`
   - `node debug/run5.js runehaven.html` — must show `CAUGHT: none`
5. **When something is unclear or unspecified, classify it before deciding
   what to do — RED always stops, YELLOW ships with a flagged note.**

   **RED — always STOP, no exceptions, regardless of how small it looks:**
   - Any test harness actually fails (`run3`/`run4`/`run5` catch a real
     error, or any `run4` line is `FAIL`) — this is the mechanical,
     objective signal that something is genuinely broken. Never overridden.
   - A patch anchor isn't unique.
   - The spec would require inventing bible content — a pet, mob, biome,
     location, or lore element not in the bible. This is a creative
     integrity rule, not a bug-severity one, and severity never overrides it.
   - The spec assumes an entire system exists that doesn't, AND building it
     properly needs 3+ genuinely unspecified, interdependent decisions with
     real gameplay consequences (a whole consumable-item framework, a whole
     new traversal/instance architecture — the kind of thing where any
     guess is really a design decision, not a tunable).

   For any RED case: do not guess, do not "fix forward" with invented
   content, do not ship a broken build. Write `BUILD_FAILED.md` at the repo
   root explaining exactly what's blocking and why, leave `runehaven.html`
   unchanged.

   **YELLOW — make the reasonable call, ship it, flag it clearly:**
   - A single tunable number or threshold is uncertain, but any reasonable
     value in a normal range keeps the game working (a rarity threshold, a
     cooldown, a light radius, a stat number within the established range
     for its rarity tier).
   - A minor naming or implementation choice where multiple options all
     work equally well (matching an existing code convention, e.g. an
     abbreviated enum name).
   - A visual/polish detail that doesn't affect functionality (an overlay
     offset, a minor color choice within an already-approved palette).
   - An implementation detail the spec left slightly underspecified, but
     where only one interpretation is actually sensible given everything
     else in the spec.

   For any YELLOW case: make the call, implement it, ship normally through
   the full gate above — but add a `## JUDGMENT CALLS THIS VERSION` section
   to the changelog entry in `SKILL.md` (or a top-level note in the commit
   message if it's not rendering-related) listing every one, in plain
   language, so it's easy to spot and revise the next morning. A version
   that shipped with flagged judgment calls is a complete, done version —
   not a partial one. The judgment calls are refinements to consider, not
   unfinished work.

   **When genuinely unsure which zone something belongs in: treat it as
   RED.** A missed YELLOW just means an unnecessary night lost, which is
   recoverable. A wrongly-shipped RED is a broken or invented build in a
   real player's hands, which is not.
6. On success: update `runehaven-art-style/SKILL.md` with a new dated
   changelog entry (rendering-scope changes only — mechanics/balance live in
   this README or commit messages, not the skill).
7. Extend `debug/run5.js`'s coverage lists with any new species/mobs/weapon
   kinds/classes added in this build, so future runs keep covering them.
8. **If the full gate passed cleanly** (every check above green, nothing
   flagged RED): attempt to push the final commit directly onto `main`,
   not just your own branch, as the very last step. If your environment
   does not permit a direct push to `main`, that's fine — land on the
   usual branch as before, no error, a human will sync it. This is a
   nice-to-have, never a requirement — never fail a build or treat a
   blocked push to `main` as a RED condition.

## Confirmed, locked spec for the next build (PIN Fixes)

**Corrected after a genuine, valuable RED.** The previous version of this
spec contained two real mistakes, both mine, not the build's — caught by
the automated process reading the actual bible and the actual file
rather than trusting the spec's own claims:

- **Guilds are dropped entirely, not scoped down.** The bible's TEAMING &
  ALLIANCES section explicitly rules out a formal guild/clan system, with
  a stated design reason ("keeps the world raw and unpredictable —
  anyone could be an enemy or an ally"). My prior spec's claim that "the
  bible scopes this as identity and grouping only" was simply wrong — it
  says the opposite. Not touched this version or any future one unless
  the bible itself is deliberately amended, which is not a call to make
  inside a build spec.
- **Admin bootstrap is dropped entirely — it was never actually
  missing.** Confirmed directly: `runehaven.html` line 4354 already reads
  `role: p.role === "admin" ? "admin" : "player"` straight off the real
  `players` table on every login — the exact mechanism the bible itself
  names ("promote other players to admin via Supabase, role column").
  The "bootstrap gap" in the prior spec was based on an incomplete search
  that only found the debug-only hook. Nothing needs building here.

**PART A — visible signal when the PIN system is inactive.** Confirmed:
`accountPinLookup()` initializes `mode: "none"` and returns early on any
`account_pins` query failure, before ever reaching the line that sets
`mode: "create"`. A missing table makes the whole feature silently
invisible, new account or not. Show a small, dismissible, one-time notice
near the username field when this happens — "PIN protection isn't active
on this world yet" — not blocking, not repeated every keystroke.

**PART B — retroactive PIN-setting for pre-existing unprotected
accounts.** Confirmed: `mode === "none"` currently means "skip the field
entirely," with no route for an existing unprotected account to ever set
one. Add an optional "Protect this name with a PIN" link shown whenever
`mode === "none"` — clicking it reveals the same create-PIN field,
submitting writes `account_pins` exactly like a new account does. Never
required, always available.

**Proof gates:** standard gauntlet plus confirm the PIN-inactive notice
shows exactly once per session, confirm the retroactive PIN link appears
only for `mode === "none"` and correctly writes `account_pins`, confirm
nothing related to guilds or a new admin table was added anywhere.

**After this version ships successfully, do not start any further
version automatically** — wait for `NEXT_BUILD.md` to be updated.
